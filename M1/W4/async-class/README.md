## Review: Synchronous JavaScript
* `JavaScript` runs from top to bottom (sequentially).
* `JavaScript` is **Single Threaded**. Only one thing can happen at a time on a **Single Main Thread**.

---

## Review: Callback
* An `anonymous function` that is being passed as an argument to a `higher-order function`.
* Anytime we request for data, it is unlikely it will be returned immediately.
* One of the options to handle `data` `asynchronously` is by `callbacks`.

---

## Asynchronous Programming
* Asynchronous JavaScript allows for tasks to be performed **without blocking** the code execution.
* A way to get expensive operations (functions) out of the way.
* Examples of `expensive` or `blocking` operations: 

```markdown
* file operations
* network requests
* reading a huge file
* database operations
* API calls
```
